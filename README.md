#_**A simple spider to get Douban top 250 list**_
>A simple scrawler to get Douban 250 list. I adopt two tools to implement the scrawler,**Jsoup** and **selenium**.
##1.Jsoup
A simple XML parser tool. What's more, it can resolve a HTML page with just a given url. It provides
incredible apis to resolve all the elements of HTML.

##2.Selenium
A automatic testing tool for web page. It works like a real brower. It contains all the movements as you wish.Such as click a button, fill a text areaï¼Œroll the page and bulabula.
